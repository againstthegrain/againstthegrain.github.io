![First MRI scan]({{ page.thumb }})

Three and a half months ago I had brain surgery to remove an acousitic neuroma--a benign tumor of the balance and hearing nerves. Physically, recovering from brain surgery is the hardest thing I have gone through. Much to my surprise, it was also the most positive experience I have ever had. But before we get into that, let's rewind to October, 2015.

### How I found it

I had gone in for a hearing test to check out the loss of hearing in my right ear. I worked construction jobs before, during and after college so I figured that had something to do with it and promptly forgot about it for a few years. It was starting to get worse so I decided to get it tested. The audiologist said it was there was no mechanical reason for the hearing loss and ordered an MRI to see if there was anything going on with the hearing nerve.

Th MRI was in the early morning. The radiologist called at lunch saying that I had a large benign brain tumor and that I would need schedule an appointment with the neurosurgeon. They penciled me in for the next day. It seemed fairly urgent so I was sort of alarmed, but it all seemed too surreal that I went on a date that night. I casually told my date about the brain tumor. She suddenly seemed less interested--it wasn't a fruitful date, needless to say.

### Meeting with the neurosurgeon

I drove from my place in Oakland down to the neurosurgeon's office in Redwood City, CA. The waiting room was a small, windowless place packed full of people waiting to talk about the state of their brain. One kid, who looked about 16, had a depressed line in his shaved head where the scalp was growing back together running along the top of his head from his forhead to the back of his skull and around the side slightly above the ear. It didn't take much work to figure out he had had a quarter of his skull taken off so they could operate on his brain. He was causually flipping through his phone. I was silently impressed by his bravery and his nonchalance was somehow reassuring. That being said however, it wasn't a particularly cheery place. You could almost smell the worry. The new arrivals were asked to take a number and told we would be helped in the order we were recieved. It was remeniscent of the DMV. Feeling like you're being processed instead of being treated compassionately at a time like that was disconcerting.

Finally my number was called and a nurse ushered me into the doctor's office. It had posters of various parts of the human brain all over the wall. They were more like schematic drawings than anything. It was kind of sinking in that this was real and I started to get scared. 

The doctor came in. He was younger guy in his early forties. He had a shiny bald head and an easy smile. A likeable guy, he said, "Hi Nathan, I'm your doctor. I'm sorry we had to meet under these conditions, let's get to it". I took his urgency to get down to brass tacks as a bad sign. He then flipped on the monitor to his computer and showed me the MRI scan at the top of this post--it was a 5.2cm acoustic neuroma. He asked me if I had trouble walking, swallowing, clumsiness in any of my extremities, headaches, or vision troubles. He seemed very surprised when I said, "Other than some loss of coordination in my right hand and hearing loss, no". We went through a few balance and reflex tests. He was visibly impressed that I could stand on one foot and walk across the tiny room in a straight line. 

He then said there are a few options for treatment typical to this type of tumor. Watch and wait, radiation and surgery. He said the first two were out of the question due to the size of the tumor and that the only viable treatment choice was surgery, and sooner rather than later becuase the tumor was pressing up against the brainstem and almost cutting off flow of cerebrospinal fluid to my spine. He then detailed all of the risks.

Stroke, meningitis, seizures, facial nerve paralysis, cerebrospinal fluid leaking out of the nose and ears, difficulty swallowing, chronic dry eye, speach problems, headaches, chronic pain, death etc. He told me about one patient that had the nerves responsible for swallowing damaged during the surgery and they had to put a feeding tube in so they could keep him nourished in the hospital while his nerves healed. The biggest risk, he seemed to think, was severing the facial nerve and as a result having to place a gold weight in my eyelid to help it close, constantly having put ointment in my eye because it wouldn't be able to self lubricate, and having to go through facial nerve grafting or plastic surgery. Also, they wouldn't be able to save the hearing in my right ear.

### Coping

That was a lot of information to digest. I left the office in tears and immediately called my mom. In retrospect that probably wasn't the best thing to do for her sake. Mothers tend to take on their kid's burdens and I was kind of a wreck so she naturally worried more than if I had called her an hour later after having processed that barrage of bad news more thoroughly.

I spent the rest of the afternoon talking with my family and trying to wrap my head around everything that was going on. My brother and friend ended up tying for the thing that lifted my spirits the most. My brother said, "Well, at least you didn't get someone pregnant". And my buddy said. "Well, you've had a pretty good run so far so at least there's that". Both of those things can sound like a fucked up thing to tell somebody who's just been diagnosed with a brain tumor, but they reminded me of two things: the impermanence of my situation, and how good life has been. Whatever happened during the surgery, I had a good chance of coming out the other side alive, albeit quite possibly with an asymetrical face. It's not like I had another human to take care of for life. And life has been incredibly kind to me. I have a super loving, supportive family, awesome friends and I've travelled the world a few times. Basically, I'm incredibly priviledged. It's humbling to know I haven't done anything to deserve it. So if it was my time to go, I realized that was ok too.

I went home, cried some more and then just kind of gave into it. The sadness, the confusion, the worry, all of it. This was the first lesson I learned **don't fight it, just surrender**. Giving into your situation and letting it wash over you, whether that be experiencing feelings of grief, sadness, anger, or ecstacy, is the first step to being at peace with what's happening. Everything passes eventually, you might as well experience it instead of trying to avoid it, even if it's unpleasant or downright terrifying.

It was one of those "resistance is futile" moments. And after giving in, another lesson presented itself. **You can't control what happens to you; you can only control how you react to it.** You've probably heard this over and over again and so had I. It's funny how you can understand things at an intellectual level and then there's a moment when you have a sudden change in consciousness where your relationship to an idea changes from one of understanding to one of knowing. This idea became true that night after my visit with the neurosurgeon. This knowledge was extremely comforting because I knew that now matter how the surgery went or what happened, I would learn every lesson I could from this situation that was forced on me. And, in a very weird way, I started looking forward to it.

The next month and a half flew by. My ex-girlfriend amazingly stepped in and involved me in her fun fall plans--concerts, music festivals, parties and the like. She made me feel so included that I almost forgot about the surgery looming a month away. I can't thank her enough for that.

In that time, I shopped around for a few other opinions and they all came back the same--surgery was the way to go. I did find a doctor at UCSF who seemed much more confident that he could save my facial nerve. That was all the information I needed. We scheduled the surgery for November 19th.

### Want what happens to you

Under the surface, a transformation was taking place. It wasn't obvious to anyone but me that I'm aware of, but my relationship with the situation was changing. At the end of summer I had started listening to Alan Watts quite a bit and was really enjoying his perspective on things. He gave an interesting talk on karma that really resonated with me. When most of us think of karma, we think of people getting punished for the bad things they do. We say things like, "karma's a bitch" when we see people who have done us wrong getting their just deserts. Alan Watts proposed that this a limited view of karma saying, "Karma is simply what happens to you, and, in a sense, you want what happens to you".

I think it might be commonplace for people in a similar situation to mine to either think "why me?" or "what did I do to deserve this?". I didn't even really have to ask those questions because I new that this was happening to me because it was happening, no other reason. And this allowed me to make peace with it in record time, **I wanted what was happening**. There's incredible freedom in this.

### With a little help from my friends

Two weeks before surgery, my friends threw me a "Tumor has it" party. We played pin the tail on the tumor using blowups of the MRI scans of my head. My friend Hope had everyone at the party snap a polaroid picture with me and write a nice note on a 3x5 card. She then compiled it into a scrapbook. It's probably the most touching thing anyone has ever done for me. The notes were amazing and I felt so loved and humbled that people cared this much. This is probably what helped me discover that 

### The universe has your back

One week before the surgery date, a very strange thing happened. I was sitting at my desk at work when I had this funny feeling. It was like someone had just covered me with a sheet pulled straight out of the dryer. This warm feeling overwhelmed me and I felt so assured in my place in the world. I'm sure my Christian friends would say it was God giving me a peace that passes all understanding, my athiest friends would say it was my mind working it's magic and helping me cope with an upcoming surgery. 

Personally, I think it was similar to what people report feeling during near death experiences or experimenting with DMT. You get this feeling that there is something in the background that loves you intensely. This can fit into anyone's belief framework. Some call it God, others might say there's a personality to the universe, cosmic consciousness etc. Whatever it was, it was incredible. I've never felt so loved and comfortable in my own skin. I hope everyone can feel it at some point in their lives.

I can say with certainty that you won't believe me until you know it for yourself. I'm sure some people are reading this thinking I'm crazy and others are reading this thinking, "finally, someone who has felt it too!" Without knowing exactly what it was, the easiest way for me to put it into words is that the universe has your back. This feeling stayed with me onto the operating table and beyond.

### Surgery

My parents and I pulled up to hospital for surgery a little before 7am. We went to a few different places, signing release forms, getting informed on what to expect for the hosital stay, and then went into the surgery preparation area. The surgeons came in, turned on a monitor and showed me and my parents the most recent MRI. They explained how the procedure would go. They would take out as much of the tumor as possible and send me on my way. They said they had no idea what the consistency of the tumor would be until they got in there. I might be soft or hard and vascular. They might be able to take it all out or I might start hemoraging as soon as they cut into it and they would have to stop the bleeding and close me up on the spot. It was anyone's guess. My parents didn't seem to happy to hear this.

I then stripped down, put on a hospital gown with about six holes in it for I.V.s, a catheter and various other tubes that I wasn't really sure of their purpose. I suspect they were important. It was a little overwhelming but I still had my trusty companion the universe so I was fortunate enough not to be too worried. When they gave me antianxiety meds through my I.V., I became even more unaffected.

They wheeled me into the operating roon and I dozed off as the anesthesiologists put pneumatic compression boots on my legs to prevent blot clots during the 11.5 hour surgery. As far as the procedure goes, I remember very little. Thank goodness that it wasn't the kind of tumor deep in the brain, the kind that required me to be awake for part of the operation so they could test my ability to talk, wiggle my toes or who knows what else. They monitored my facial nerves using electrical sensors on my face so they knew when to stop cutting. (This is a huge oversimplification of brain surgery, but it's the easiest way to process what actually happened--highly skillful removal of a tumor from my brainstem, facial nerve, and other surrounding critical structures).

The next thing I remember was rolling out of the OR to the ICU with my parents walking next to me. I asked my mom, "How did it go?", not aware that my ability to ask that question was a great sign. She said, "Really well". That was very reassuring. Upon arriving in my room in the ICU, they started asking me a ton of questions. What year is it. What city are we in. What's your name. How many brothers and sister do you have. At the time they seemed like completely ridiculous questions, "Of course I know what year it is, I just want a drink of water". In retrospect, it makes more sense. I had just had my skull opened for half a day.

Apparently, my lips were very chapped and a nurse asked me if I wanted Carmex or ChapStick®. The complexity of this dicision was too much. I looked at the only familiar face I could find and pleaded, "Mom, make her stop asking me questions--it's stressing me out". She politely informed the nurse that I was a ChapStick® man. This was my first lesson in recovering from brain surgery **making choices is incredibly overwhelming--best to avoid it**.

### The hospital stay

I spent the night in the ICU, not really knowing the details of the surgery, just that it had gone "well" from what I could gather from my mom in that hazy hallway conversation. As I lay there that night with the sounds of beeping machines filling the room, I felt the right side of my face moving, and that my eye was tearing up--the facial nerve was at least partially intact. I offered up a quick word of thanks and then promptly passed out.

I woke up around 5 in the morning thirsty as all get-out. I asked the nurse for some water and she said she wasn't allowed to because I would just throw it up or choke (the nerves responsible for swallowing were a bit weak). I talked her into giving me a sponge on a stick to soak in water and wet my dry lips and mouth. Apparently wet sponges on a stick are such common request that they have them in a hospital and she gave in. I was very excited to say the least. This was the first time of many that the smallest wins were a huge reason to celebrate. The same would be true in the coming weeks for succesfully going to the bathroom.
