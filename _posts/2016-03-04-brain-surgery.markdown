![First MRI scan]({{ page.thumb }})

Three and a half months ago I had brain surgery to remove an acousitic neuroma--a benign tumor of the balance and hearing nerves. Physically, recovering from brain surgery is the hardest thing I have gone through. Much to my surprise, it was also the most positive experience I have ever had. But before we get into that, let's rewind to October of 2015.

### How I found it

I had gone in for a hearing test to check out the loss of hearing in my right ear. I worked construction jobs before, during and after college so I figured that had something to do with it and promptly forgot about it for a few years. It was starting to get worse so I decided to get it tested. The audiologist said it was there was no mechanical reason for the hearing loss and ordered an MRI to see if there was anything going on with the hearing nerve.

Th MRI was in the early morning. The radiologist called at lunch saying that I had a large benign brain tumor and that I would need schedule an appointment with the neurosurgeon. They penciled me in for the next day. It seemed fairly urgent so I was sort of alarmed, but it all seemed too surreal that I went on a date that night. I casually told my date about the brain tumor. She suddenly seemed less interested--it wasn't a fruitful date, needless to say.

### Meeting with the neurosurgeon

I drove from my place in Oakland down to the neurosurgeon's office in Redwood City. The waiting room was a small, windowless place packed full of people waiting to talk about the state of their brain. It wasn't a particularly cheery place. You could almost smell the worry. The new arrivals were asked to take a number and told we would be helped in the order we were recieved. It was remeniscent of the DMV. Feeling like you're being processed instead of being treated compassionately at a time like that was a little disconcerting.

Finally my number was called and a nurse ushered me into the doctor's office. It had diagrams of the human brain all over the wall. They were more like schematic drawings than lifelike. It was kind of sinking in that this was real and I started to get scared. 

The doctor came in. He was younger guy in his early forties
